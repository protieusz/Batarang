# Batarang
Batman theme ~~handwired~~ keeb. KLE remixed by jade the maid and pcb design by yours truly. MCU used is Pimoroni PGA2040.

Rev 6, fixed mcu outline, added Cirque trackpad outline. Currently being printed and finger crossed. Still need to figure out the Cirque coding.

Rev 2 pcb design. Might got straight to pcb instead and skip handwiring. Front side. Will use a Cirque Glidepoint Trackpad instead.
